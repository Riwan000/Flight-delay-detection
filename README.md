## Overview
Welcome to the Flight Delay Prediction Project! This repository showcases a machine learning model built to predict flight delays based on historical data. With the increasing complexity of air traffic and operational challenges, this project aims to provide insights and assist in minimizing delays.

## Dataset
The data used in this project is sourced from the IBM Developer Exchange: [Airline Dataset](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/airline/). It includes detailed flight information such as:
- Flight times (Scheduled and Actual)
- Arrival and Departure delays
- Weather conditions
- Other operational details

## Features of the Dataset
Key columns include:
- **CRSArrTime**: Scheduled arrival time
- **CRSDepTime**: Scheduled departure time
- **ArrTime**: Actual arrival time
- **DepTime**: Actual departure time
- **WeatherDelay**: Delay due to weather conditions
- **CarrierDelay**: Delay due to airline carrier issues
- **NASDelay**: Delay caused by the National Airspace System
- **SecurityDelay**: Delay caused by security measures
- **LateAircraftDelay**: Delay due to previous aircraft delays

For a detailed description of all features, refer to the [dataset page](https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/airline/).

## Project Goals
1. **Analyze** flight delay patterns and trends.
2. **Build** a predictive model using machine learning algorithms.
3. **Evaluate** model performance and optimize for accuracy.
4. **Visualize** insights to aid decision-making for airlines and passengers.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data analysis and machine learning.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For an interactive development environment.
